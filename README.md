# Zoo ‚Äî Software Engineer, CAD Data (Demo Project)
 
Welcome to the `zoo-cad-data-software-engineer` repository. This project serves as a **comprehensive demonstration portfolio** to simulate the technical responsibilities and skills required for a **Software Engineer, CAD Data** role at Zoo Design Studio.

It is structured around a mock job description and showcases a curated selection of coding samples, configuration files, shell scripts, and architectural documentation that align with the expectations of enterprise-grade data engineering work.

> üìç **Note:** This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Zoo Design Studio. All files and examples are hypothetical and solely for educational purposes.

## üîß Technologies Covered

- CAD metadata with Python  
- Build schema-driven ETL pipelines  
- Geometry computations and data conversions  
- Apply Git, SQL, and warehouse best practices  
- Integrated CAD and analytical systems

## Example Implementation

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, asdict
import hashlib, json, csv, os

@dataclass
class PartRecord:
    part_id: str
    assembly: str
    material: str
    mass_kg: float
    bbox_x: float
    bbox_y: float
    bbox_z: float
    checksum: str

def sha256(path):
    h = hashlib.sha256()
    with open(path, "rb") as f:
        for chunk in iter(lambda: f.read(8192), b""):
            h.update(chunk)
    return h.hexdigest()
```

This script standardizes mass and geometry units, validates required fields, generates checksums, and writes normalized data for ingestion into a warehouse.

---

## SQL Schema Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE cad_parts (
  part_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  assembly TEXT NOT NULL,
  material TEXT,
  mass_kg DOUBLE PRECISION CHECK (mass_kg >= 0),
  bbox_x DOUBLE PRECISION,
  bbox_y DOUBLE PRECISION,
  bbox_z DOUBLE PRECISION,
  checksum CHAR(64) UNIQUE,
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);
```
